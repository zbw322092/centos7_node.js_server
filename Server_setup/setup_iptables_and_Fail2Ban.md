# Setup iptables and Fail2Ban

## iptables vs firewalld
The relationship between iptables and firewalld.
> FirewallD is frontend controller for iptables used to implement persistent network traffic rules.

Differences:
> 1. FirewallD uses zones and services instead of chain and rules. 
>2. It manages rulesets dynamically, allowing updates without breaking existing sessions and connections.

>FirewallD is a wrapper for iptables to allow easier management of iptables rulesâ€“it is **not an iptables replacement**.


I use firewalld to coontroll network traffic in my server.
I modified configuration based on public zone.
> public: Represents public, untrusted networks. You don't trust other computers but may allow selected incoming connections on a case-by-case basis.

Configuration Example:(excerpt from [5])
``` bash
# allow http services permanently
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=http
``` 

Common Command in `firewalld`
``` bash
# start the daemon for this session
sudo systemctl start firewalld.service

#  verify that the service is running and reachable
firewall-cmd --state

# print out the default zone's configuration
firewall-cmd --list-all

# which zone is currently selected
firewall-cmd --get-default-zone

# active zone
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones

# get zones
firewall-cmd --get-zones

# get services
firewall-cmd --get-services

# add services
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http

sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=http

# add ports
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=5000/tcp

# restart firewall service
sudo systemctl restart firewalld.service
```
